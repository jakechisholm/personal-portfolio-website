              In a group with other individuals, I helped lead embedded development and real-time state machine design for a Pacemaker device, which was developed
              on a FRDM-K64F ARM Microcontroller. The state machine, programmed in MATLAB&apos;s Simulink, was capable of pacing multiple bradycardia operating modes, making use of
              Stateflow to develop control algorithms. In addition, I was solely responsible for developing communications protocols in Stateflow through UART, in order to 
              enable telemetry exchange with the external medical GUI software, developed by other members on the team. Visible to the left is an overview of the Simulink design.

              Across the courses COMPENG 2SH4 and COMPENG 2SI3 at McMaster, we got to develop the snake game, fully based in the command line terminal.
              Initially, the game was developed independently using OOP principles. While completing 2SI3, the game&apos;s featureset became far more robust, as we 
              developed various data structures and algorithms from scratch to supplement gameplay. This DSA featurset included: Re-factoring the Snake growth algorithm
              to make use of Linked Lists, using Queues for input commands in multiplayer gameplay, as well as Binary Search Trees and Hashing.

              In a group with two other individuals, I assisted in developing a multi-player fighting game, played on a single device.
              This game was programmed in Java, utilizing the libGDX game engine. This game included full menu navigation, multiple characters
              with unique movesets, Computer Player Characters &#40;CPUs&#41;, multiple stages, unlockables & more. This project is publicly accessible

              In a team with two other individuals, I am currently developing a website called Eng Academy, focusing on front-end and UI/UX design.
              The purpose of this website is to provide a one-stop-shop for engineering students of all fields to have strong academic resources and 
              interview prep. Think sort of somewhere between Khan Academy and Duolingo, but for university level engineering content. Planned for first release
              in Fall 2025!

              For my first foray into hardware projects, I am seeking to combine my passion for music & playing musical instruments with my interest in DSP
              and embedded systems. I plan to refactor an old CASIO synthesizer to house a set of microcontrollers & PCBs to perform both modular synthesis and
              play preset sounds. The software side would make use of existing C++ libraries, and would be controlled by a touchscreen GUI. Project is still in
              research phase, completion TBA.
